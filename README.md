# Server Example
A simple application to view, edit, insert or delete items from a database table.

# Intro

This application is divided in two parts: a server-side and a client-side application. The client-side performs http requests to the server-side in order to list, edit or delete records and the server-side responds providing XML documents. Those XML documents are interpreted by the client-side.

# Install the server-side

The server-side is installed as a typicall web application (PHP + Apache + MySQL).
